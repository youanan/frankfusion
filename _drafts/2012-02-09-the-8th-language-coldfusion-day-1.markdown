Reading Seven Languages in Seven Weeks teaches us, amongst other things, to look at programming languages from a wide-angled,
wood-seeing perspective. It provides a simple framework of properties to categorize languages by, before zooming in to
examine the language's implementation of each of those properties in greater detail. But how often do we do this with the
language that we use day in and day out? Would we even know the answer's to Mr Tate's simple categorizing questions?
Here is my attempt at presenting language number 8, ColdFusion. Day 1...<!--more-->

#ColdFusion

Meet CF, an unpopular but bright rich kid who'll bribe you with gifts of his foster Mum's perfume to sleep with him. Look past
his adoptive parent's wealth and his penchant for hanging a sweater over his shoulders however, and you'll find an easy-riding,
earnest and robust worker with a few ideas of his own (and plenty borrowed from just about everywhere else).

##Day 1, The Seducing

*Did you know that ColdFusion can play darts? Blindfold?*

ColdFusion is a dynamically typed, procedural language for the JVM. It offers a classical Object Oriented pattern to use with your
*own* code, but does not provide native objects of its own. You do not have to use the OO feature set.
It offers two styles of syntax, one script based and the other tag based. The tag based language fits in smoothly for outputting
HTML, the script based language for just about everything else. You are free to use either in any context.

It has a dazzling array of built-in functionality: pdf, zip, ms-office document and image manipulation made super easy; hibernate
based ORM and a super simple and direct SQL querying implementation.
