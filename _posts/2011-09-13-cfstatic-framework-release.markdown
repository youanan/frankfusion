I am very pleased and excited to announce the public beta release of CfStatic, a framework for the inclusion and packaging of CSS and JavaScript files for CFML applications!<!--more-->.

I have been using it privately for a while now and think it is pretty neat, making managing your CSS and JavaScript across a complex (or simple) application an absolute breeze.

The full details can be found over at the project's GitHub site where you'll find the source, a wiki and an issue tracker (please don't post bugs here!):

There's also a project on riaforge:

Enjoy!
