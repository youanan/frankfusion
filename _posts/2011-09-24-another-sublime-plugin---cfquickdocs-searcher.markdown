Here's another Sublime Text 2 plugin. Once again, its a little rough but it does the job (on Ubuntu at least).<!--more-->

The plugin adds a command to launch <http://cfquickdocs.com>, searching the docs for the word in which the cursor / selection currently resides. The command has a default key binding of **alt-shift-h** and can be configured to search against CF7, 8 or 9. All settings can be accesses via **Preferences->Package Settings->CF Quick Docs->...**

Enjoy.
